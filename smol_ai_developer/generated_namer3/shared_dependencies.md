Based on your prompt, the files we have decided to generate are:

- `naming_scheme_generator.py`: This file will contain the main method for generating the random name.
- `theme_loader.py`: This file will contain a method for loading the theme options from the JSON file.
- `name_generator.py`: This file will contain the logic for generating the random name based on the loaded theme options.

The shared dependencies between these files are:
